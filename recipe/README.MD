## Data Storage

### Hash
***Parent Class: `Object`. Included Modules: `Enumerable`.***

* A Hash is a dictionary-like collection of unique keys and their values. Also called associative arrays, they are similar to Arrays, but where an Array uses integers as its index, a Hash allows you to use any object type.
* Hashes enumerate their values in the order that the corresponding keys were inserted.
* A Hash can be easily created by using its implicit form:

* Storing data in Ruby comes in different ways. As we have seen at the `zoo` folder `class` is not the only soltion.
Hash is another easy solution. A Hash is a dictionary-like collection of unique keys and their values. 


### Struct
***Parent Class: `Object`. Included Modules: `Enumerable`.***

* A Struct is a convenient way to bundle a number of attributes together, using accessor methods, without having to write an explicit class.
* The Struct class generates new subclasses that hold a set of members and their values. For each member a reader and writer method is created similar to `Module#attr_accessor`.
